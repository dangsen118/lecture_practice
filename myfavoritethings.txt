Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens,
Bright copper kettles and warm woollen mittens,
Brown paper packages tied up with strings,
These are a few of my favorite things...

When the dog bites and the bee stings
When I'm feeling sad
I simply remember my favorite things
And then I don't feel so bad
