Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens,
Bright copper kettles and warm woollen mittens,
Brown paper packages tied up with strings,
These are a few of my favorite things...
When the dog bites and the bee stings
When I'm feeling sad
I simply remember my favorite things
And then I don't feel so bad

i love you like the moon and stars
when little kids get hit by cars
