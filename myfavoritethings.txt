Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens,
Bright copper kettles and warm woollen mittens,
Brown paper packages tied up with strings,
These are a few of my favorite things...
<<<<<<< HEAD

Passing my EECS class and maybe graduting
Getting gigs and composing good music. 
=======
When the dog bites and the bee stings
When I'm feeling sad
I simply remember my favorite things
And then I don't feel so bad
